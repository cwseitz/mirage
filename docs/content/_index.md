# Mirage

The mirage project constructor was called in late 2020; as a whole, the project
is dedicated to the search for 20/20 computer vision. Currently, we are on
sub-project init() and after the initial build, mirage will be a minimal Python
library with a core in C, providing the basic building blocks of a
biologically-realistic visual model. Users can build such models de-novo
or from one of our templates.

Mirage is not an ordinary deep-learning solution to computer vision although
the architecture bares similarity to object-oriented projects like PyTorch. As
scientists, we prioritize biological realism and make extensive use of a
theories of the brain coming from neuroscience and theoretical physics.

Perhaps the most useful way to study intact brains is through imaging.
We are interested in the fundamental mechanisms the visual pathway uses
to encode the visual field and the communication of visual information
to other brain regions that assign meaning to that information. To that end,
we index several microscopy datasets and provide a host of standard
computer vision functions to extract quantitative information from them.

## Who we are

We are a team of scientists and engineers from all over the world. We come
from backgrounds in physics, computer science, neuroscience, and
software engineering.

## What we do

As a team, we are trying to push the fields of computer vision
and artificial intelligence forward. Current models of visual
perception fail to generalize, and we intend to change that.
